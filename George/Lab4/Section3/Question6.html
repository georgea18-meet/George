<p id="p1">Harry couldn’t see how eight people, six large trunks, two owls,
and a rat were going to fit into one small Ford Anglia. He had reckoned,
of course, without the special features that Mr. Weasley had
added. </p>
<p id="p2">It was nearly midnight, and he was lying on his stomach in bed, the blankets drawn right over his
head like a tent, a flashlight in one hand and a large leather-bound book (A History of Magic by
Bathilda Bagshot) propped open against the pillow. Harry moved the tip of his eagle-feather quill
down the page, frowning as he looked for something that would help him write his essay, ‘Witch
Burning in the Fourteenth Century Was Completely Pointless — discuss.’</p>
<p id="p3">Annoyed, but absolutely convinced he was right, Harry snatched
up a pile of filthy Quidditch robes and left the room; Mrs. Weasley
had been urging them for days not to leave their washing and packing
until the last moment. On the landing he bumped into Ginny,
who was returning to her room carrying a pile of freshly laundered
clothes. </p>
