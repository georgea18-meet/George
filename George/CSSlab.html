<h1 class="my_class">Welcome to the wonderful world of penguins!!!</h1>
<p class="my_class">The UN (United Nations) has fought the use and stockpiling of chemical weapons during the last few decades. The CWC (Chemical Weapons Convention) is a treaty that aims to destroy chemical weapons, it was signed by 165 countries in 1993. Under the CWC, 93% of the worldâ€™s chemical weapons were destroyed. Also, The Un has established the OPCW (Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons), and its mission is to implement the provisions of the CWC.

<p id="second">China has sticked to its commitment, and destroyed all its production facilities, and has stopped its chemical program before the ratifying the CWC convention. China has vetoed many resolutions which imposes unjustified sanctions, and called for deeper investigations in order to address the issues in hand more efficiently. It is clear that the Syrian government is not using any chemical weapons due to the fact that its stockpile had been destroyed back in 2014, and the fact that the UN mission report has indeed confirmed that the rebels were using chemical weapons.
